# Villager Pickup

Allows you to pickup villagers into spawn eggs by **shift right clicking** on one. 

The villager spawn egg will retain all nbt data of the villager which means it will stay the same way you picked it up.

### Compatibility
Because of the way this mod is coded, it **works with all modded villagers** by default if they are not a separate entity (for example you can't pick up wandering traders) but this can be easily changed with a very small amount of coding knowledge.

The mod is **fully server side** and vanilla clients can use it when it's installed on the server side.
